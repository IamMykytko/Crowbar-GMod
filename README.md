# Crowbar Garry's Mod Tool
The "Crowbar" tool for Garry's Mod and other Source engine games is

==a vital utility for **modding and custom content creation**==. You would need it primarily for the following purposes: 

- **Decompiling Models:** It converts the game's binary model files (`.mdl`) into editable text and mesh files (like `.smd` and `.qc`) that can be used with 3D modeling software. This allows you to view the structure of existing models or use them as a base for your own creations.
- **Compiling Models:** It provides a user-friendly interface for the game's official compiler (`studiomdl.exe`), which is necessary to turn your custom model files and instructions (`.qc` files) back into the `.mdl` format that Garry's Mod can read and use in-game.
- **Unpacking Game Files:** It can open and extract content from various Valve package files, such as VPK archives and Garry's Mod GMA files. This is essential for accessing the raw assets (models, textures, sounds) from other games to use or modify for your GMod projects.
- **Viewing Model Information:** It acts as a debugger, letting you see what textures, meshes, and other files a model requires, which is useful for troubleshooting why a model might not be working correctly in-game.
- **Publishing to the Workshop:** It includes a feature to publish your finished addons to the Steam Workshop, serving as an alternative to the in-game tools. 

In short, the Crowbar tool is not a weapon you use in the game itself (that's a different in-game item); it is a **powerful external application** you use on your computer to create, modify, and manage custom content for Garry's Mod. You would typically use it in conjunction with a 3D modeling program (like Blender) and a text editor.
